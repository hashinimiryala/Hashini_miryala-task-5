# 🚦 Task 5 - Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

## 🛠 Objective:
To capture live network packets using Wireshark and identify basic protocols and traffic types such as TCP, DNS, and HTTP.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used:
- *Wireshark* (free and open-source packet analyzer)

---

## 📁 Packet Capture Details:

- *Filename:* hasini_miryala_task5_capture.pcapng  
- *Duration:* ~1 minute  
- *Traffic Generated By:*
  - Visiting www.google.com, www.wikipedia.org
  - Running ping google.com in Command Prompt

---

## 🔍 Protocols Identified:

### 1. *TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)*
- Used for reliable data transmission.
- Seen during communication between browser and web servers.

### 2. *DNS (Domain Name System)*
- Resolves domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.
- DNS query and response packets were captured.

### 3. *HTTP5 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)*
- Used to load web pages.
- Seen while accessing websites like google.com.

---

## 🧠 Observations:
- Captured multiple TCP packets with SYN, ACK flags indicating handshakes.
- DNS packets show hostname resolution in action.
- HTTP requests contain header information for webpage loading.
